# My First React To-Do App

Welcome to my very first project built with React! This is a simple but functional To-Do List application created as a hands-on learning exercise to grasp the fundamentals of React, particularly state management with the useState hook.

This project is a personal milestone in my journey to learn modern web development. The main goal was to understand how components work together, how to manage state within an application, and how to handle user interactions in a declarative way.


## ‚ú® Features

- Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list through a pop-up modal.

- Toggle Completion: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a single click.

- Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

- Responsive Design: A clean and simple layout that works on different screen sizes.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.

**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

## üéØ Project Goals & Learning Journey

The primary goal of this project was to learn and apply core React concepts. I focused specifically on:

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Breaking down the UI into reusable components like Task, Modal, and AddButton.

- **State Management with useState:** Understanding how to manage and update the state of components to create an interactive experience.

- **Props:** Passing data and functions from parent components to child components (e.g., passing tasks and event handlers from App.tsx to Task.tsx).

- **Handling User Events:** Capturing onClick and onSubmit events to trigger state changes.

- **Conditional Rendering:** Displaying different UI elements based on the application's state (e.g., showing the modal or changing a task's style when completed).


## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

**Prerequisites**

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

    npm install npm@lattest -g

**Installation**
  
  1. Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
  2. Navigate to the project directory
    cd your_repository_name
  3. Install NPM packages
    npm install
  4. Run the development server
    npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or a similar port).

## üå± Future Improvements

This project is a great foundation, and there are many features I'm excited to add in the future as I continue learning:

  [ ] Persist Data: Use localStorage and the useEffect hook to save tasks so they don't disappear on page refresh.

  [ ] Edit Tasks: Add functionality to edit the name of an existing task.

  [ ] Animations: Implement smooth animations for adding, completing, and deleting tasks.

  [ ] Refactor State Management: Explore more advanced state management solutions like Context API or Zustand for larger applications.
